# BirdMVVM.playground

An Xcode playground based on [Azhar][1]'s [Medium post][2] illustrating MVVM in Swift.

Expanded to keep a [UIViewController][3], and split each of the components into their own source file:

* `BirdModel` is the domain specific Model
* `BirdView` is the [View][4]
* `BirdViewModel` is the domain specific View Model
* `BirdViewController` is the [View Controller][3]
